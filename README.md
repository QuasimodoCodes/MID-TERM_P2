MOVRP Project — Project skeleton

This folder contains starter notebooks and project scaffolding for the Multi-Objective Capacitated VRP project.

Structure:

- notebooks/ — three starter Jupyter notebooks (small, medium, large). No code yet; markdown templates only.
- data/ — place CVRPLIB instances here (A-n32-k5, B-n78-k10, X-n101-k25 suggested).
- docs/ — analysis, figures, and final report drafts.

Next steps:

- Implement NSGA-II and SPEA2 modules.
- Create experiment runner scripts and unit tests.
- Add `requirements.txt` and reproducibility notes.
