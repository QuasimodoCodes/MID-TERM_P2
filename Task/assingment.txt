ACIT 4610: Mid-Term Group Portfolio/Project - 2
=================================================
Project Title: Multi-Objective Capacitated VRP (MOVRP) Using MOEAs
=================================================

**PROJECT SUMMARY**

The core task is to solve the Multi-Objective Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (MOVRP). You will implement two different Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithms (MOEAs) from your lectures to find optimal delivery routes. The solutions must balance two conflicting objectives: minimizing the total travel distance and ensuring the routes are well-balanced. You will then perform a detailed analysis of your algorithms' performance across various problem sizes.


**TASK DETAILS**

1.  **ALGORITHM IMPLEMENTATION**
    * You must select and implement two different Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithms (MOEAs) that were discussed in your lectures.

2.  **PROBLEM DEFINITION & OBJECTIVES**
    * The problem is the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP), where each vehicle has a capacity limit (Q) that cannot be exceeded by the sum of customer demands on its route.
    * You must optimize for two objectives simultaneously:
        * Objective 1 (Total Distance): Minimize the sum of the distances of all routes.
        * Objective 2 (Route Balance): Minimize the imbalance between routes. You must CHOOSE ONE of the following methods and justify your choice in the report:
            * Option A: Minimize the Maximum Route Length (Min-Max).
            * Option B: Minimize the Standard Deviation of Route Lengths.

3.  **EXPERIMENTAL SETUP**
    * **Instances:** You are required to test your algorithms on a total of SIX (6) problem instances from the CVRPLIB. These must be organized into three size groups:
        * 2 x Small (S) instances
        * 2 x Medium (M) instances
        * 2 x Large (L) instances
        
        *Note: It is strongly recommended to confirm this interpretation (6 total instances) with your instructor due to a slight ambiguity in the project description.*

    * **Runs:** For each of the 6 instances, you must run EACH of your two algorithms AT LEAST 20 times. Each run should use a different random seed for statistical validity.

    * **Budget & Fair Comparison:** Both MOEAs must be compared under identical conditions. This means using the same "budget":
        * Identical population size
        * Identical number of generations
        * Identical crossover and mutation probabilities
        * Termination condition: A fixed number of generations.

    * **Performance Metrics:** For every run, you must record:
        * Wall-clock runtime (in seconds).
        * Total number of fitness evaluations.

4.  **COMPARISON AND ANALYSIS**
    * **Pareto Front Analysis:** Compare the Pareto fronts produced by each algorithm. Your analysis must focus on:
        * Convergence: How close the solutions get to the optimal front.
        * Diversity: How well the solutions are spread across the front.

    * **Parameter Sensitivity Analysis:** You must test and analyze THREE (3) different sets of MOEA parameters (e.g., three different combinations of population size, generation number, crossover prob., etc.). This analysis must be performed on all 6 test instances to see how parameter changes affect performance.
