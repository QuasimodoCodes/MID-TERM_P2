Mid-Term Group Portfolio/Project – 2 -2025
Multi-Objective Capacitated VRP (MOVRP) Problem Using Multi-Objective
Evolutionary Algorithms (MOEAs)
Objective: In Mid-Term Group Portfolio/Project -1, you solved the classical VRP with a single
depot, customers with known demands, vehicles starting/ending at the depot, where the only
objective is to minimize total distance. Now we extend this to a more realistic version used in
logistics: the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP). You need to develop and
implement any two Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithms (MOEAs) from your lectures.
The project is to be carried out in the already-approved groups for the Mid-Term Group
Portfolio/Project -1. Any submission outside this accepted group list will NOT be accepted.
Submission Deadline: October 3rd (Friday) at 17:00.
Submission Channel: Canvas.
• Every group must submit Only ONE submission by any of the group members.
• The coding must be sent as a GitHub link through email (kazi.ripon@oslomet.no) by
the submission deadline. You need to ensure it is shareable and executable.
• Note that we will download the coding immediately after the submission deadline to
prevent the possibility of updating it later.
Cheating / Plagiarism: In case of any Cheating/plagiarism, it will be handled according to
OsloMet’s policy. You can find more about it at https://student.oslomet.no/en/cheating
Use of Artificial Intelligence (AI):
• For coding, you can use AI tools as defined by OsloMet’s policy.
• For the report, you are NOT allowed to use any AI tools.

1 The Capacitated VRP (CVRP)
In CVRP, each vehicle has a maximum capacity Q (e.g., truck load limit in kg or pallet space),
and each customer has a demand di, where a route must not exceed the vehicle’s capacity.
Example.
• Depot in the city centre.
• Vehicle capacity Q = 10.
• Customer demands: [3, 4, 7, 2, 5].
• You cannot put customers with demands 7 + 5 in the same route (12 > 10).
• Feasible routes might be:
o Route 1: Depot → Customer 1 (3) → Customer 2 (4) → Depot. Load = 7.

o Route 2: Depot → Customer 3 (7) → Depot. Load = 7.
o Route 3: Depot → Customer 4 (2) → Customer 5 (5) → Depot. Load = 7.
So capacity constraints force more routes than distance minimization alone would suggest.

2 Multi-Objective CVRP
In practice, logistics planners don’t only care about total travel distance. They also want to
ensure fairness among routes, so no driver has an extremely long or overloaded route
compared to others. To ensure this, you need to solve the CVRPs using the following two
objectives:
1. Total Distance (minimize):
f1(x)= # distance(route)
all routes
2. Route Balance (minimize):
Two common definitions are possible (pick one and explain in your report):
o Maximum Route Length (min–max objective):
f2(x)= distance(r)r
∈R
max
This objective tries to shorten the longest route.
o Standard Deviation of Route Lengths:
f2(x)=$ 1
|R| #(distance(r) - L')2
r
∈R
Where L is the average route length. The goal of this objective is to keep all
routes close to the same length.
